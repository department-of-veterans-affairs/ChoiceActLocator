# Choice Act Locator

This web mapping application provides veterans the ability to search and find Non VA Care providers through the Choice Act.
   
## What is the Choice Act?
On August 7, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146) (“Choice Act”). Technical revisions to the Choice Act were made on September 26, 2014, when the President signed into law the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-175).

VA’s goal continues to be to provide timely, high-quality healthcare for Veterans. Veterans and VA employees nationwide understand the need for reform, and VA is committed to putting these reforms into place.

## Where can I find the application in action?
The application has been deployed (within some minor changes) to the [Choice Act Locator] (http://www.va.gov/opa/apps/locator/) 

## Deploying the Application
The build folder contains all the code needed to run the application.  The source code is located in the app folder.

## Do I need a proxy?
As long as the browser is HTML5 compliant, no proxy should be needed.
